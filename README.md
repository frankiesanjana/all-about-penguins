# All About Penguins

All About Penguins is a site that aims to provide information about penguins. It is designed to cater for a range of users by providing some scientific data, a gallery of images and video that are both educational and enjoyable to look at, and some interesting facts alongside a contact form to submit further questions. The website is structured around user needs by providing a landing page that contains the basic information, a gallery page for users who are interested in images and a trivia page that includes interesting facts and a contact form for user questions.

The site has been created for the first milestone project for Code Institute's Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.
