# All About Penguins

All About Penguins is a site that aims to provide information about penguins. It is designed to cater for a range of users by providing some scientific data, a gallery of images and video that are both educational and enjoyable to look at, and some interesting facts alongside a contact form to submit further questions. The website is structured around user needs by providing a landing page that contains the basic information, a gallery page for users who are interested in images and a trivia page that includes interesting facts and a contact form for user questions.

The site has been created for the first milestone project for Code Institute's Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.

## Concept

The website has been developed to provide a solution for the following user stories and owner goals. User stories are focused around specific needs that users to an informational site are likely to have. Owner goals take into account why a potential owner could be interested in developing such a website.

### User Stories

- As a new visitor to the site, I want a site that is attractive, so that I enjoy using the site.
- As a new visitor to the site, I want a site that is easy to navigate, so that I can find what I need easily.
- As a returning visitor to the site, I also want a site that is easy to navigate, so I can easily confirm information that I have seen previously.
- For all users, I want to be able to access the site from whatever device and screen size I choose.
- As a user who is doing research for a presentation, I want a site that is clear and informative.
- As a user who is searching for trivia information (e.g., for a quiz), I want a site that contains interesting facts that are not necessarily well-known.
- As a user who is just browsing, I want a beautiful site that is easy to read with interesting information.
- As a user who is just browsing, I want a beautiful site with attractive images
- As a user who is particularly interested in and enjoys the subject matter, I want to enhance my knowledge.
- As a user who is particularly interested in and enjoys the subject matter, I want to be able to ask further questions to find out more.
- As a user who is particularly interested in and enjoys the subject matter, I want to follow the page on social media, so I can see more information about real-life experiences or updates to the site.

### Owner Goals

- As the site owner, I want to fulfil the needs and wishes of these users.
- As the site owner, I want to provide clear and accurate information.
- As the site owner, I want to provide an enjoyable experience for users.
- As the site owner, I want users to be able to access the site from any size of device.
- As the site owner, I want to obtain user feedback via a contact form.

## Design

The website was designed according to the five planes of content strategy. Using this structure provided a framework to develop the website. This is explained in more detail below.

### Plane 1: Strategy

The strategy of the website is largely defined by the user and owner goals listed above in the Concept section. The strategy is simply to provide solutions to the goals of the website's users and owners.

### Plane 2: Scope

The website includes the following information:
- An informational section for the user who is researching a project or who is particularly interested in the subject matter
- A gallery for all users, but particularly those with a special interest in the subject matter or who are just browsing
- A trivia section, for a user who is searching for interesting snippets of information for a quiz, particularly interested in the subject matter, or the user who is just browsing
- A contact form to ask about further information, for the user who is particularly interested in the subject matter

The following elements were considered but ultimately deemed to be out of scope of the current website. They could be added to a future version:
- Additional factual information about penguins: excluded because it could have led to 'information overload' with too much information for users to absorb
- A quiz for users to test their knowledge and win a prize: excluded because it is not effective to design a quiz with the HTML and CSS technologies used in this project; it would be better with JavaScript, which is beyond the scope of this project

### Plane 3: Structure

The website consists of three main pages, with a short fourth page.
- The landing page is also the main information page. It provides introductory basic facts about penguins, height and weight information and scientific classification information, along with two images to illustrate how penguins look both on land and underwater.
- The second page is a gallery page, containing a video that can be played by the user, another image and a photo collage.
- The third page combines the trivia information with a contact form. This is because users who are looking for more information in the trivia section but do not find what they are looking for are likely to want to fill out the contact form.
- The fourth page provides a message for users who have submitted the contact form, and redirects them back to the site's main page.

The website is multi-page to enable easier navigation. Navigation could be difficult if the whole website was placed on a single page since the amount of content on one page would become unwieldy.

### Plane 5: Surface

#### Colour Scheme

A simple colour scheme is used to provide an attractive background to the website without detracting from the content. Since the website has a relatively large number of media items, it was important to select a neutral background colour that would fit well with a wide range of other colours.

#### Typography

The fonts are designed to be clear and easy to read, and again intended to be relatively neutral so that they do not take focus away from the content. A serif font for the headings and a sans serif font for the main website text provide a clear and aesthetically pleasing contrast.

#### Media

The pictures and video on the website were sourced from the stock photography sites [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/). The two images on the information page are selected to show penguins in their two main habitats, to provide as complete an overview as possible in a limited number of images. The images are all selected because they are clear, attractive and interesting, and are intended to show a range of different types of penguins in different group sizes and settings. The video provides a visual impression of a group of penguins; unfortunately no suitable videos were available with sound.

#### Presentation

The website is designed to maintain consistency of look and feel. For example, alignment is kept as consistent as possible within and between pages; sub-headings on all pages are always accompanied by Font Awesome images; images that do not fill the whole width of the viewport are displayed to the right of accompanying text, with any captions placed below the corresponding media. The style of writing and tone is also intended to maintain a consistent feel to the website.

## Features

### Titles

<img src="readme-images/screenshots/title.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a page title">

- Each page has a heading that provides the user with an instant overview of the type of content they can expect to find on that page.
- This allows the user to see at a glance what subject matter is addressed on each page.

### Navigation Bar

<img src="readme-images/screenshots/nav-bar.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the navigation bar as it appears on mobile">

- Each page features a navigation bar, with the same keyword that is featured in the titles. This is identical between pages to allow for easy navigation.
- This provides consistency to the user and allows them to navigate quickly and intuitively between the different pages, on any device, without needing to use the ‘back’ button.
- The navigation bar appears as pictured below the main page headings on mobile; on larger screens above 1000 pixels it appears as a horizontal bar on the right-hand side of the page.

### Subtitles

<img src="readme-images/screenshots/subheading.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a subtitle">

- Subheadings break the pages up into manageable and meaningful sections, to aid in within-page navigation and summarise their content.
- Each subheading is accompanied by a relevant Font Awesome icon, to decorate the text and provide an at-a-glance hint as to the subject matter of the section.

### Main Page

<img src="readme-images/screenshots/main-page.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the main page of the website as it appears on larger screens">

- The landing page begins with some basic free text information and images, followed by a table containing some data and scientific classification information.
- This section provides the user with plenty of information, while also featuring eye-catching images to draw the user’s attention.
- The page aims to present the most useful information first, i.e., key information about penguins with images to show the detail of what they look like. The information on penguin size follows to give supporting information. The scientific classification is important and should be included but may not be immediately meaningful to many users, so this appears at the end of the page.

### Gallery Page

<img src="readme-images/screenshots/gallery-video.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the gallery page with video as it appears on mobile">

- This page begins with a video, to allow users to see penguin behaviour in motion.

<img src="readme-images/screenshots/gallery-collage.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the gallery page with photo collage as it appears on mobile">

- The page also features plenty of images for users to enjoy and to learn more about the different types of penguins and what they look like. This includes a photo collage, which is designed using media queries to adjust in size based on the user's screen size, from 2 pictures wide on mobile devices up to 4 pictures wide on larger screens.

### Trivia Page

<img src="readme-images/screenshots/trivia-page.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the trivia page as it appears on larger screens">

- This page features a trivia section, to provide interesting facts about penguins. 
- The trivia section is accompanied by further images to provide further information and add interest.

<img src="readme-images/screenshots/image-text.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the text and image on the trivia page as it appears on mobile">

- On mobile devices, the "Fun Facts" section risks appearing overly long, with a large block of text in one go. To address this issue there is an image that displays on smaller screens only to break up the text.

### Contact Form

<img src="readme-images/screenshots/contact-form.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the contact form as it appears on mobile">

- The trivia page also includes a contact form, so that users can submit questions that are not already answered on the site.
- The form includes fields for a user to provide their first name, last name and email address, as well as a free text section for users to ask for more information.
- The user’s first name, email address and comments or questions are required fields on the form, so that questions can be received and a response can be correctly addressed and sent
- The last name is optional, since it is not necessary to collect this information in order to fulfil the purpose of the form. Some users may prefer not to provide their last name, and in some cultures people do not necessarily have both first and last names

### "Form Received" page

<img src="readme-images/screenshots/thankyou-page.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the thankyou page as it appears on mobile">

- This page is displayed when a user successfully submits a contact form.
- It displays some text to assure a user that their form has been submitted correctly and the data received.
- It is also designed to encourage users to spend further time on the site, by linking back to the main page in the thankyou text and including the normal navigation bar at the top of the page.

### Footer

<img src="readme-images/screenshots/footer.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the footer as it appears on mobile">

- The footer contains links to the social media sites for All About Penguins. So that the user can navigate easily, these links open in a new tab.
- These links are valuable to the user because they will be able to receive updates and find out more information via social media.
- Like the navigation bar, the footer is identical between the different pages. If a user initially does not click on a social media link but wishes to do so later while viewing a different page, this will allow them to find the link easily, without having to navigate between different pages.
