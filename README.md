# All About Penguins

All About Penguins is a site that aims to provide information about penguins. It is designed to cater for a range of users by providing some scientific data, a gallery of images and video that are both educational and enjoyable to look at, and some interesting facts alongside a contact form to submit further questions. The website is structured around user needs by providing a landing page that contains the basic information, a gallery page for users who are interested in images and a trivia page that includes interesting facts and a contact form for user questions.

The site has been created for the first milestone project for Code Institute's Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.

## Concept

### User Stories

- As a new visitor to the site, I want a site that is attractive, so that I enjoy using the site.
- As a new visitor to the site, I want a site that is easy to navigate, so that I can find what I need easily.
- As a returning visitor to the site, I also want a site that is easy to navigate, so I can easily confirm information that I have seen previously.
- For all users, I want to be able to access the site from whatever device and screen size I choose.
- As a user who is doing research for a presentation, I want a site that is clear and informative.
- As a user who is searching for trivia information (e.g., for a quiz), I want a site that contains interesting facts that are not necessarily well-known.
- As a user who is just browsing, I want a beautiful site that is easy to read with interesting information.
- As a user who is just browsing, I want a beautiful site with attractive images
- As a user who is particularly interested in and enjoys the subject matter, I want to enhance my knowledge.
- As a user who is particularly interested in and enjoys the subject matter, I want to be able to ask further questions to find out more.
- As a user who is particularly interested in and enjoys the subject matter, I want to follow the page on social media, so I can see more information about real-life experiences or updates to the site.

### Owner Goals

- As the site owner, I want to fulfil the needs and wishes of these users.
- As the site owner, I want to provide clear and accurate information.
- As the site owner, I want to provide an enjoyable experience for users.
- As the site owner, I want users to be able to access the site from any size of device.
- As the site owner, I want to obtain user feedback via a contact form.

## Design

The website was designed according to the five planes of content strategy. Using this structure provided a framework to develop the website. This is explained in more detail below.

### Plane 1: Strategy

The strategy of the website is largely defined by the user and owner goals listed above in the Concept section. The strategy is simply to provide solutions to the goals of the website's users and owners.

### Plane 2: Scope

The website includes the following information:
- An informational section for the user who is researching a project or who is particularly interested in the subject matter
- A gallery for all users, but particularly those with a special interest in the subject matter or who are just browsing
- A trivia section, for a user who is searching for interesting snippets of information for a quiz, particularly interested in the subject matter, or the user who is just browsing
- A contact form to ask about further information, for the user who is particularly interested in the subject matter

The following elements were considered but ultimately deemed to be out of scope of the current website. They could be added to a future version:
- Additional factual information about penguins: excluded because it could have led to 'information overload' with too much information for users to absorb
- A quiz for users to test their knowledge and win a prize: excluded because it is not effective to design a quiz with the HTML and CSS technologies used in this project; it would be better with JavaScript, which is beyond the scope of this project

### Plane 3: Structure

The website consists of three main pages, with a short fourth page.
- The landing page is also the main information page. It provides introductory basic facts about penguins, height and weight information and scientific classification information, along with two images to illustrate how penguins look both on land and underwater.
- The second page is a gallery page, containing a video that can be played by the user, another image and a photo collage.
- The third page combines the trivia information with a contact form. This is because users who are looking for more information in the trivia section but do not find what they are looking for are likely to want to fill out the contact form.
- The fourth page provides a message for users who have submitted the contact form, and redirects them back to the site's main page.

The website is multi-page to enable easier navigation. Navigation could be difficult if the whole website was placed on a single page.

#### Colour Scheme

A simple colour scheme is used to provide an attractive background to the website without detracting from the content. Since the website has a relatively large number of media items, it was important to select a neutral background colour that would fit well with a wide range of other colours.

#### Typography

The fonts are designed to be clear and easy to read, and again intended to be relatively neutral so that they do not take focus away from the content. A serif font for the headings and a sans serif font for the main website text provide a clear and aesthetically pleasing contrast.

#### Media

The pictures and video on the website were sourced from the stock photography sites [Pexels] (https://www.pexels.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/). The two images on the information page are selected to show penguins in their two main habitats, to provide as complete an overview as possible in a limited number of images. The images are all selected because they are clear, attractive and interesting, and are intended to show a range of different types of penguins in different group sizes and settings. The video provides a visual impression of a group of penguins; unfortunately no suitable videos were available with sound.

#### Presentation

The website is designed to maintain consistency of look and feel. For example, alignment is kept as consistent as possible within and between pages; sub-headings on all pages are always accompanied by Font Awesome images; images that do not fill the whole width of the viewport are displayed to the right of accompanying text, with any captions placed below the corresponding media. The style of writing and tone is also intended to maintain a consistent feel to the website.
