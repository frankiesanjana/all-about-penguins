            Basic Penguin Facts
        </h2>
        <p>
            Antarctic penguins have a striking black and white coat. The distinctive colours and features of each penguin species are on their heads and neck — some are black and white, some have yellow patches, and others have elaborate coloured eyebrows.

            Although they have wings and feathers, penguins cannot fly. Instead, they have evolved into the most efficient swimmers and divers of all birds. Some species spend 75% of their time at sea – the most of any birds. Penguin wings are stiff, short flippers to propel them underwater – they literally fly through the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
            The number of living penguin species is debated. Depending on the source and the classification used, there are between 17 and 20 extant penguin species. Of these, only two make the Antarctic continent their true home, although others (chinstrap, gentoo and macaroni) breed on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. King penguins only breed on the warmer more northerly subantarctic islands. One species, the Galapagos penguin, even lives on the Equator.
