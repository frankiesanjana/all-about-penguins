                No one knows for sure where the name 'penguin' came from. It could come from the Welsh ‘pen gwyn’, which means ‘white head’, or from the Latin ‘pinguis’, referring to the fat or blubber of the bird. The name penguin was first given to another type of bird, the auk (also a large, flightless, black and white bird).

                The penguin diet consists mainly of fish, squid and crustaceans. Penguins can adapt their diet to what is available, and their diet varies considerably with season.

                Electronic dive recorders fitted to the backs of penguins record  the times and depths of their dives. The deepest diving penguins are the kings and emperors as they search for squid and fish; the record holder is a female emperor penguin who reached an astonishing 535 metres.

                The Linux operating system has a penguin called Tux as its mascot, and the original version of this penguin is the logo displayed next to the title above.

                Penguins evolved from flying birds (petrels) about 50 million years ago. There were at least 25 species, many of which have become extinct. Some were larger than the ones that exist today, with one species as tall as a human (170cm).

                A group of penguins on land is called a waddle, and a group of penguins in the water is a raft.
